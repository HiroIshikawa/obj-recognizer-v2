# obj-recognizer-v2

## Goals
- This projects aims at implementing the real-time object recognition system for multi-purpose applications.
- The performance matters. In addition to the accurate run, this should run in any system with realtively low computational resource like raspberry-pi.
- This leverages pre-bulid trained models like YOLO and apply that to practical operations like robotics routine.
- Ultimately, this aims at running the most sophisficated model on the mobile devices in massive scales.

## Preliminary Research
